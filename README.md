major project in ultrasonic project


The objective of this project is to design and implement an autonomous robot that can be controlled remotely via Bluetooth, with collision avoidance features powered by ultrasonic sensors. The robot's movement is controlled using a smartphone application, which communicates with the robot through the HC-06 Bluetooth module. The robot incorporates an ultrasonic sonar sensor and servo motor for distance detection and obstacle avoidance.
